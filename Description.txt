When frabricating Microfluidic biochips using a micromilling machine, the instruction set inserted is G-Code. 
Our aim is to make a compiler such that the chip can be written in VHDL and then compiled into G-Code to simplify the complex fabrication.


When frabricating Microfluidic biochips using a micromilling machine, the instruction set inserted is G-Code. 
Our aim is to make a compiler such that the high-level design for the chip can be written in a hardware descriptive language and then compiled into G-Code to simplify the complex fabrication.


First draft
---------------------------------
Microfluidic biochips (also known as  lab-on-a-chip) are an alternative to conventional biochemical laboratories, and are revolutionizing biology.
These biochips are becoming increasingly complex, with thousands of components, but are designed manually, which is extremely labor intensive and error prone.

The need for ways to more easily design the biochips is therefore becoming more apparent. The instructions are read in the form of "G-Code", when fabricating these biochips using a micromilling machine.
Our aim is to design a descriptive language in which the high-level design for the chip can be written in and then compiled into G-Code to simplify the complex fabrication.
