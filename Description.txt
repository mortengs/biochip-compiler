When frabricating Microfluidic biochips using a micromilling machine, the instruction set inserted is G-Code. 
Our aim is to make a compiler such that the chip can be written in VHDL and then compiled into G-Code to simplify the complex fabrication.


When frabricating Microfluidic biochips using a micromilling machine, the instruction set inserted is G-Code. 
Our aim is to make a compiler such that the high-level design for the chip can be written in a hardware descriptive language and then compiled into G-Code to simplify the complex fabrication.
