Do we need to create a parser?

What language do you recommend us writing this in?

What is MHDL? Is there any documentation of this (need to understand the scale)?

Is MHDL already implemented and if so, where can we find it?

Are we supposed to work with Alexander and Lasse’s CAD Tools?

What is input and output (MHDL -> G-code)?

Is this G-code only supposed to be created for our machine?

Alexander and component library. Do we need it?

How would our solution be different from Alexander and Lasse’s?
