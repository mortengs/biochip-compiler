	Q&A
--------------------

Do we write a compiler?
	Do we know how to place the components on the chip?
	What about the routing?

Do we need to create a parser?

What language do you recommend us writing this in?

What is MHDL? Is there any documentation of this (need to understand the scale)?

Is MHDL already implemented and if so, where can we find it?

Are we supposed to work with Alexander and Lasse’s CAD Tools?

What is input and output (MHDL -> G-code)?

Is this G-code only supposed to be created for our machine?

Alexander and component library. Do we need it?

How would our solution be different from Alexander and Lasse’s?

How much do we need to be able to verify if our code is correct?

Is it possible to analyse and optimise?
