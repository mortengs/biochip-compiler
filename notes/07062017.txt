Comments on the structure

Manual could come at the end

Instead of manual chapter ~As appendix

-> Problem formulation -- What is the problemm. Start from aqua and get MHDL ...What do we want
Define the problems that we want to solve.

After the Theory -- Instead of manual.

Theory 
Change to "Models" or "System Models"
	We present the aqua language

Biochip models, what are they composed of
Biochip modeling language
	MHDL

Assay modelling language Aqua

Starts from high level and explains the languages

Don't include theory as much as concepts that are needed later for example IR
Only what is needed to understand what is done.

Before design.
-> Chapter on Solution -- How are things set together BIG PICTURE
What goes in where, what algorithm and what are inputs and outputs

From here we can point to the other chapters, where things are explained in detail
Where do we have the parser and what is used in the parser.
Diagram to explain the "flow"

Implementation and Testing.
-> Not as much the full detail as much as specific libraries, class diagrams and test.
How did we validate the outputs.
Not so muchexhaustive as much as highlighting what is important.


Algorithm node levels for computing the urgency of the operations

From our point of view, the instructions are just instructions
two choices, ignore the filter or suggest and extention to AQUA
make up a syntax and show how we handle it in our code.
Ignore it for the moment. and if we have time, look into it.

look away from the entities

Is this enough to actually model these designs?
Can we fabricate the chip from just the mhdl?
is it sufficient?? Take some actual chips

Alex might have some suggestions for some chips to model
Organic Analyser Chip --

Evaluate the language -- MHDL 

Until next week ->
