# Q&A

1. *Do we write a compiler?*

2. *Do we know how to place the components on the chip? What about the routing?*

3. *Do we need to create a parser?*

4. *What language do you recommend us writing this in?*

5. *What is MHDL? Is there any documentation of this (need to understand the scale)?*

6. *Is MHDL already implemented and if so, where can we find it?*

7. *Are we supposed to work with Alexander and Lasse’s CAD Tools?*

8. *What is input and output (MHDL -> G-code)?*

9. *Is this G-code only supposed to be created for our machine?*

10. *Alexander and component library. Do we need it?*

11. *How would our solution be different from Alexander and Lasse’s?*

12. *How much do we need to be able to verify if our code is correct?*

13. *Is it possible to analyse and optimise?*
